# YOLOv11 Phase Detection in AOT/Oil/Water Experiments

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a **YOLOv11** object detection model to identify and classify **phases in an AOT/Oil/Water experiment**, 
including the ability to **calculate phase sizes**.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Detect and classify distinct phases (e.g., AOT, oil, water) in experimental setups involving surfactants and liquids.
- **Model:** YOLOv11 (fine-tuned)
- **Additional Processing:** Post-inference phase size estimation based on detected bounding boxes.

## Experiment Context

The AOT/Oil/Water system is a classic three-phase system studied in soft matter and colloidal science. The fine-tuned YOLOv11 model helps:

- Automatically detect phase boundaries.
- Quantify the relative sizes of each phase.

##  Model Training

- **Base Model:** YOLOv11 pre-trained on COCO
- **Custom Dataset:** Manually labelled images of the AOT/oil/water system using bounding boxes with the roboflow tool
- **Classes:**
  Vial  
  foam  
  slightly turbid  
  transparent  
  very turbid
-**Framework** The model was trained using Ultralytics pip install

## How to Train YOLO11 STFA
Create a new conda environment and install ultralytics for training as the ali branch and main branch are not compatible for trainnig.
- Create and anotate the dataset using roboflow
- Download the dataset
- In the train.py put the version of the data you want to use (n,s,m,l,x) file in the model = YOLO("yolo11n.yaml") Line for example the medium model trains with model = YOLO("yolo11m.yaml")
- pretrained weights are from the coco dataset which almost always produces worse results when tuning for chemitry.
- In the results = model.train() make sure the data= hyperparameter is pointing to the location of the data.yaml file in your newly created dataset
- once the model has trained the weights should be in the runs/detect/name_of_the_training/weights

## How to run the project

  Clone the repository and add the model to the folder.
  Run the main.py
  Select a video source
  Place the vial(s) between 5 and 20 cm for best results.
  Set up the experiment by choosing a folder to store the results.
  Either configure the timer for automatic inference or click the capture and detect button to run the inference manually.
